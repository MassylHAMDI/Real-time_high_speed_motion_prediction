In this folder, you will find the essential files for our implementation of the algorithm:

- data_visualization.py: Allows for the visualization of events as 3D point clouds. It loads and displays event data from a .mat file,
                representing them according to their position and time, and offers the option to color points based on their polarity.

- vision_project.py: Used to calculate the local and corrected flow (after max-pooling) for each event in the data. 
                Simply select the .mat file and adjust the number of events by modifying the max_range.

- flow_visualization.py: Intended for visualizing flow data on images. It loads coordinate and flow data, 
                then creates and displays dynamic images for visual interpretation of the flow.

- utils.py: Contains utility functions to support the proper functioning of the entire code.

- requirements.txt: Lists all the Python libraries needed to run the mentioned scripts. Make sure to install these dependencies for a smooth execution.



In this folder, alongside the essential files for our algorithm implementation, you will find a video tutorial explaining how to run the code and showcasing the results obtained after execution. 
This video serves as a practical guide to help you understand the setup and visualize the outcome effectively. Ensure to refer to it for a step-by-step walkthrough and insights into the expected outputs.
